# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
AI implementation of the classic tic tac toe game

The rule is pretty simple!

• Each player places his/her player number in a 3x3 grid, alternatively taking turns

• The winner is the one who gets his number placed in a complete row/column/diagonal/anti-diagonal.

• There might also be a tie when the above condition isn't satisfied

This is an attempt to use AI to play tic tac toe using python, numpy
